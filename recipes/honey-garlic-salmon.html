    <h2>This Honey Garlic Salmon is a terrific way to serve salmon that is just so quick and delicious! </h2>
    <p>This Honey Garlic Salmon recipe is all about the sauce. Just four simple pantry essentials in the right proportions – soy sauce, honey, garlic and vinegar.</p>
    
    <h4>Ingredients for this Honey Garlic Salmon:</h4>
    <p>This delicious recipe comes together in around 15 minutes. Typically, I love to serve this with jasmine rice, steamed broccoli and carrots.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Sauce:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>4 tablespoons honey</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce (all purpose or light soy sauce)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp white vinegar (or sub with any other vinegar except balsamic)</li>
        <li>1 large garlic clove (or 2 small) , minced</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Salmon:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 salmon or trout fillets, skinless (6oz / 200g each)</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Optional garnishes:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sesame seeds</li>
        <li>Finely sliced chives or shallots/scallions</li>
    </ul>
        
    <h4>Instructions:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Warm the olive oil in a large Dutch oven or pot over medium heat. One-fourth cup olive oil may seem like a lot, but it adds a lovely richness and heartiness to this nutritious soup.</li>
        <li>Once the oil is shimmering, add the chopped onion and carrot and cook, stirring often, until the onion has softened and is turning translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the garlic, cumin, curry powder and thyme. Cook until fragrant while stirring constantly, about 30 seconds. Pour in the drained diced tomatoes and cook for a few more minutes, stirring often, in order to enhance their flavor.</li>
        <li>Pour in the lentils, broth and the water. Add 1 teaspoon salt and a pinch of red pepper flakes. Season generously with freshly ground black pepper. Raise heat and bring the mixture to a boil, then partially cover the pot and reduce the heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the lentils are tender but still hold their shape.</li>
        <li>Transfer 2 cups of the soup to a blender. Securely fasten the lid, protect your hand from steam with a tea towel placed over the lid, and purée the soup until smooth. Pour the puréed soup back into the pot. (Or, use an immersion blender to blend a portion of the soup.)</li>
        <li>Add the chopped greens and cook for 5 more minutes, or until the greens have softened to your liking. Remove the pot from the heat and stir in 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. Taste and season with more salt, pepper and/or lemon juice until the flavors really sing. For spicier soup, add another pinch or two of red pepper flakes.</li>
        <li>Serve while hot. Leftovers will keep well for about 4 days in the refrigerator, or can be frozen for several months (just defrost before serving).</li>
    </ol>
