    <h2>This Honey Garlic Salmon is a terrific way to serve salmon that <br> is just so quick and delicious! </h2>
    <p class="center">This Honey Garlic Salmon recipe is all about the sauce. Just four simple pantry essentials in the
        right
        proportions – soy sauce, honey, garlic and vinegar.</p>
    <br>


    <h3 class="align">Ingredients for Honey Garlic Salmon:</h3>
    <p>This delicious recipe comes together in around 15 minutes. Typically, I love to serve this with jasmine rice,
        steamed broccoli, carrots & edamame.</p>
    <br>


    <p><strong>Sauce:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>4 tablespoons honey</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce (all purpose or light soy sauce)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp white vinegar (or sub with any other vinegar except balsamic)</li>
        <li>1 large garlic clove (or 2 small) , minced</li>
    </ul>
    <br>


    <p><strong>Salmon:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 salmon or trout fillets, skinless (6oz / 200g each)</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <p><strong>Optional garnishes & sides:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sesame seeds</li>
        <li>Finely sliced chives or shallots/scallions</li>
        <li>Steamed Carrots, Broccoli and Edamame</li>
        <li>Jasmine Rice</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Take salmon out of the fridge 20 minutes before cooking. Pat salmon skin dry with a paper towel and sprinkle
            with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Whisk together the Sauce ingredients in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Drizzle oil in a non stick fry pan and heat over medium high heat (or just under, if your stove runs hot).
            Place salmon in the pan, and cook the first side for 3 - 4 minutes until golden. Turn, then cook the other
            side for 2 - 3 minutes or until golden.</li>
        <li>Pour Sauce over salmon. Cook for 1 minute or until it starts to thicken slightly. Check the side of the
            salmon to tell how cooked through the middle is - I like mine medium rare inside. (Note 1). If Sauce
            thickens too much before your salmon is cooked to your taste, just add water 1 tbsp at a time.</li>
        <li>Remove and place onto serving plates.</li>
        <li>Serve salmon drizzled with sauce, sprinkled with sesame seeds and chives/shallots, if desired, add a side of
            steamed rice, broccoli and carrots.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>

    <h3>Recipe Notes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>I tell how cooked a salmon is by eye, looking at the side of the salmon. I like mine to be coral inside
            (rare to medium rare), not pale pink and fully cooked. You can use a thermometer if you want. Insert it into
            the thickest part - it should be 120F / 50C for medium rare or 130F / 55C for medium.
            Remember, the salmon will keep cooking for a minute after removing from the pan.</li>
        <li>Nutrition per serving, assuming all the sauce is used, which is may not be (a lot of it remains in the fry
            pan).</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
