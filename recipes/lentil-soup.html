    <h1>The World's Best Lentil Soup</h1>
    <img src="images/best-lentil-soup.jpeg" alt="photo of prepared lentil soup">
    <h2>This soup recipe was a long time coming!</h2>
    <p>Over the years, I made some lackluster lentil soups that never saw the light of day on this website. No vegetarian food blog would be complete without a proper lentil soup, though, so I perfected one of my own. Here it is. My lentil soup is made with mostly pantry ingredients but includes hearty greens and a squeeze of lemon for bright, fresh flavor. It’s seasoned with a few of my favorite spices and plenty of freshly ground black pepper. Honestly, it’s the best lentil soup I’ve ever had.</p>
